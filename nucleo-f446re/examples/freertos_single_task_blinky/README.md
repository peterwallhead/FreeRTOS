Toggles the built-in LED on the NUCLEO-F446RE STM32 development board every 2000ms (2 seconds) in a single task thread running within FreeRTOS.

Adapted from the [Getting Started with STM32 - Introduction to FreeRTOS](https://www.digikey.com.au/en/maker/projects/getting-started-with-stm32-introduction-to-freertos/ad275395687e4d85935351e16ec575b1) guide from Digi-Key. This guide was written for the NUCLEO-L476RG, but the steps to enable FreeRTOS using CubeMX, and generate the code, were the same.
